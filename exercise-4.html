<h2>Exercise 4. std::mutex from scratch.</h2>

<p>
This exercise is supposed to drive home the proper usage of a mutex&ndash;condition-variable pair
to protect access to shared data.

<p>
Open <a href="https://wandbox.org/permlink/8lURJet879iGmrTF">this wandbox</a>
(<a href="4.cc">backup</a>). You'll see an implementation of a "<code>ThreadSafeStack</code>"
that may or may not actually be thread-safe.

<p>
1. Read the definitions of <code>push</code> and <code>blocking_pop</code>. (Ignore the
letter <code>Y</code> in the margin.) Read the test case in <code>main</code>; figure out
what it's testing for. Does it make sense? Run the code. Does it seem to work? (It should.)

<p>
2. Now look at the <code>Y</code> in the margin. In the "Compiler Options" on Wandbox, replace
<code>-DY=</code> with <code>-DY=std::this_thread::yield();</code> and re-run the code.
It segfaults! This shows that the original code has a bug, and the bug manifests itself
only when a context-switch happens at exactly the right time.

<p>
3. Given what you know about the proper use of <code>mutex</code> and <code>condition_variable</code>,
find and fix the bug. (Your fix should actually make the code shorter and simpler.) When you're
done, run the code again; it should no longer segfault, with or without the calls to
<code>yield</code>.

<p>
4. (Optional) This "<code>ThreadSafeStack&lt;T&gt;</code>" is somewhat dangerous, because
lines 20, 30, and 31 all run user-supplied code under a mutex lock. Imagine, or write,
a <code>class Widget</code> such that <code>ThreadSafeStack&lt;Widget&gt;</code> would
misbehave (deadlock, segfault, etc).

<p>
5. (Optional) Browse the code for concurrency primitives in Arthur's
<a href="https://github.com/Quuxplusone/from-scratch/tree/master/include/scratch/bits/concurrency">from-scratch repo</a>.
You might particularly want to read <a href="https://github.com/Quuxplusone/from-scratch/blob/master/include/scratch/bits/concurrency/mutex.md">mutex.md</a>.

You're done with the fourth set of exercises! Sit back and relax, or optionally,
